### 🧢 **The Ultimate Fantasy Baseball Championship Awaits — Are You In?**

Fantasy baseball has evolved. It’s no longer just about setting lineups and crossing your fingers. It’s about projections, analytics, and unlocking the true DNA of performance. That’s why the **Fantasy Baseball Championship Series (FBCS)** is here — a battleground built for competitive minds, strategic thinkers, and baseball lifers.

Whether you're the seasoned veteran who drafts like a GM or the upstart sabermetrician who’s been crunching data since November, this league was designed with **you** in mind.

#### 💸 High Stakes, Higher Rewards

At \$250 per team, the FBCS isn’t just a fantasy league — it’s a competitive ecosystem. The stakes are high because the prizes are even higher.

* **\$1000 to the league winner**
* **\$500 to the runner-up**
* **Free entries for teams that finish Top 5**
* **And best of all…**
* **The League Champion gets a VIP Ticket to the FBCS Super League** — a \$10,000 winner-take-all championship tournament where the best of the best face off in a final showdown.

Add it up and you’re looking at over **\$22,000+ in championship prize pools**, not counting the weekly bonuses, early signup rewards, and promotional giveaways.

#### 🔥 What Makes This Different?

Most leagues rely on outdated systems. Standard 5x5 scoring. Snake drafts. Random luck.

Not here.

The FBCS uses a **7x7 modernized roto scoring system** tailored around today’s game — featuring stats like:

* Barrel%
* Expected OBP (xOBP)
* Saves + .7× Holds (SVH3)
* CSW% (Called Strikes + Whiffs)
* Quality Appearances (QA4)

It’s not just about the closers and cleanup hitters. It’s about **reliability**, **pitch value**, **expected stats**, and **real-world contribution**.

You’re not just building a fantasy team… you’re building a **baseball dynasty**.

#### 🥇 Bonuses, Discounts, and Deals

To reward loyalty and give new managers an edge, we’re offering a **\$25 discount** to any team that signs up by **January 31st**. That means you’re in for \$225 instead of \$250.

Refer a friend and get **\$10 extra** toward your next league or Fantasy365 gear.

Plus, if you join multiple leagues, you’ll be entered into a **bonus raffle** for:

* MLB.tv subscriptions
* Custom fantasy trophies
* Autographed memorabilia
* And even a **spotlight interview** on the FBCS podcast

#### 📊 A League for Strategists, Not Slackers

We’ve partnered with **FanGraphs**, **DraftBuddy**, and **Baseball Savant** to create the most accurate, cutting-edge player ranking tools in the industry.

It’s skill vs. skill. And that’s what makes it special.

Inside the league, you’ll get access to:

* Private Discord war rooms
